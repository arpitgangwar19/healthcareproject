      <p class="significance-paragraph">The thyroid gland generates hormones that are involved in numerous bodily processes, a tiny gland in the shape of a butterfly that is 
        situated beneath the skin at the front of your neck. It is primarily in charge of regulating the rate of metabolism in your body. Thyroxine (T4)
         and triiodothyronine (T3), are the two primary hormones that the thyroid produces which are combined to form thyroid hormone. (1,2).</p>
      <img src="/images/blogs/blog-diet-image.svg" alt="Significance Image" class="significance-image ">
      <p class="significance-paragraph">Thyroid disease is characterized by the excess or insufficient production of these vital hormones by the thyroid gland.

      <h3 class="significance-subheading">Types of Thyroid disorders-</h3>
      <ul class="significance-list">
        <li>
            Hypothyroidism
          <p class="significance-paragraph">It is a condition in which your thyroid does not produce enough hormones. What symptoms indicate hypothyroidism?
            Fatigue, an intolerance to cold temperatures, weight gain or difficulty to reduce weight, constipation, a slowed heart rate, 
            and coarse hair and skin are some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism <span class="color-change">(4).</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>Hyperthyroidism
            <p class="significance-paragraph">It occurs when your thyroid produces more hormones than it should and overworks. If you have hyperthyroidism, you may 
            experience fatigue, weight loss or gain depending on your appetite, heat intolerance, palpitations, tremors, diarrhea, excessive
            sweating, and hair thinning <span class="color-change">(2,4).</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

            <p class="significance-paragraph">An inflammatory condition called Hashimoto's thyroiditis causes the thyroid gland to become inflamed. It results in goiter
                (neck swelling brought about by an enlarged thyroid gland) <span class="color-change">(4,5).</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>Thyroid cancer

            <p class="significance-paragraph">Small, benign growths called thyroid nodules and adenomas begin in the layer of cells that lines the inner surface of the
                thyroid gland. Thyroid hormone may be secreted by the adenoma itself, which could lead to hyperthyroidism <span class="color-change">(5).</span></p>
        </li>

        <li>Postpartum thyroiditis

            <p class="significance-paragraph">It is the inflammation of the thyroid after childbirth. Initially causing hyperthyroidism, postpartum thyroiditis might eventually
                lead to hypothyroidism <span class="color-change">(6).</span></p>
        </li>

      
      </ul>


      <h3 class="significance-subheading">How do certain diet plans help people with thyroid disorders?</h3>

      <p class="significance-paragraph">
        For hypothyroidism - Walnuts, soybean flour, cottonseed meal, iron supplements or multivitamins containing iron and, 
calcium supplements <span class="color-change">(6,7).</span>

<br>
For hyperthyroidism - Eat foods fortified with calcium and/or vitamin D, such as dairy products, orange juice, eggs, salmon,
and other foods, as Grave's disease can cause bone loss and osteoporosis, and these foods can help prevent these problems <span class="color-change">(7).</span>
<br>
Protein-rich foods like chicken, turkey, beans, and nuts can help you maintain your current muscle mass and may even help 
you gain weight because weight loss is a major sign of hyperthyroidism <span class="color-change">(6,7).</span>
<br>
Cruciferous veggies, including cauliflower, cabbage, kale, brussels sprouts, and radish also help with hyperthyroidism <span class="color-change">(6).</span>
<br>
For postpartum thyroiditis – Foods high in selenium in your diet that includes eggs, beans, tuna, sardines, and Brazil nuts 
help combat postpartum thyroiditis <span class="color-change">(8).</span>
<br>
The absorption of thyroid medications can be dramatically impacted by specific vitamins and even coffee <span class="color-change">(7).</span>  
    
    </p>
