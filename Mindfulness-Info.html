        everyday life. It is typical. Our mind's main purpose is to think. All that matters is how we manage it. The ability of mindfulness
        aids in keeping the focus on the here and now.

<li><p class="significance-paragraph"><span class="bold-content">Check in with your senses-</span> Pay attention to your body's physical sensations, such as the breeze across your skin, the tingle

              perseverance, you'll end up where you want to be.</p>
