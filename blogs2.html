        caught up or overwhelmed by what is happening around us. (1)</p>

      <p class="significance-paragraph">If we can't manage our thoughts, they will dominate us. The goal is to discover novelties, generate fresh ideas, and escape from
        everyday life. It is typical. Our mind's main purpose is to think. All that matters is how we manage it. (2) The ability of mindfulness
        aids in keeping the focus on the here and now.
    <br>
    Therefore, practicing mindfulness is a way to calm our minds and control our thoughts, feelings, and behavior (3).

        center stage, freedom emerges. Learning to strike a balance between thoughts and present situations leads to freedom of life (3,6).
