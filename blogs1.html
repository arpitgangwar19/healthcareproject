        necessary. The issue with this is that you'll wind up spending much more money on solving the problem than you would on
        avoiding it in the first place.
    <br>

      <ul class="significance-list1">
        <li>
          <p class="significance-paragraph">It cannot be disputed that <span class="color-change">diagnostic services</span> have played a significant role in the development of medical research. 
            Medical intervention at an appropriate time is only made possible through diagnostic tests. It plays a vital role in the
            various stages of disease management. Blood, stool, tissue, and urine tests are a few of the most used diagnostic 
            techniques that evaluate whether a person has a certain medical condition or not.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="significance-paragraph">Another aspect of preventive care is <span class="color-change">mental well-being.</span> Substance abuse disorders, which frequently end in overdoses,
                can be caused by mental health issues. Additionally, our activity levels, eating patterns, and stress levels can all be adversely
                impacted by our mental health, which can result in a variety of additional health issues. Before they have an adverse effect
                on other aspects of a person&#39;s life, mental health examinations for conditions like depression are crucial.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <p class="significance-paragraph">Due to their simplicity and high level of effectiveness,  <span class="color-change">vaccinations</span> are possibly the most popular preventative healthcare 
                option. Vaccines can now prevent polio and other illnesses like diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella.</p>
